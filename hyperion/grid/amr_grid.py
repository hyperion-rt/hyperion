    An AMR grid.

    Levels are stored in the ``levels`` attribute, which is a list of
    :class:`hyperion.grid.amr_grid.Level` objects, which in turn
    contain a ``grids`` attribute which is a list of
    :class:`~hyperion.grid.amr_grid.Grid` objects.

    Levels can be added with::

        level = amr.add_level()

    And grids can be added to a level with::

        grid = level.add_grid()

    Grid objects have the following attributes which should be set:

        * ``xmin`` - lower x position of the grid
        * ``xmax`` - upper x position of the grid
        * ``ymin`` - lower y position of the grid
        * ``ymax`` - upper y position of the grid
        * ``zmin`` - lower z position of the grid
        * ``zmax`` - upper z position of the grid
        * ``nx`` - number of cells in x direction
        * ``ny`` - number of cells in y direction
        * ``nz`` - number of cells in z direction
        * ``quantities`` - a dictionary containing physical quantities (see below)

    :class:`~hyperion.grid.AMRGrid` objects may contain multiple
    quantities (e.g. density, specific energy). To access these, you can
    specify the name of the quantity as an item::

         >>> grid['density']

    which is no longer an :class:`~hyperion.grid.AMRGrid` object, but
    a :class:`~hyperion.grid.AMRGridView` object. When setting
    this for the first time, this can be set either to another
    :class:`~hyperion.grid.AMRGridView` object, an external h5py
    link, or an empty list. For example, the following should work:

        >>> grid['density_new'] = grid['density']

    :class:`~hyperion.grid.AMRGridView` objects allow the
    specific dust population to be selected as an index:

        >>> grid['density'][0]

    Which is also an :class:`~hyperion.grid.AMRGridView` object.

        Convert a yt dataset to a Hyperion AMRGrid object

        .. note:: This method requires yt 3.0 or later

        Parameters
        ----------

        ds : yt Dataset
            The yt dataset
        quantity_mapping : dict
            A dictionary mapping the name of the quantity to use in Hyperion (the
            key) to the name of the field to extract in yt (the value).

        Notes
        -----

        The domain is always re-centered so that the position at
        ds.domain_center in yt becomes the origin in Hyperion.

        Examples
        --------

        Assuming that your dust opacities are defined per unit gas mass, and the
        simulation density is given in gas densities, converting is
        straightfoward (in this case we assume the density field is called
        ``('gas', 'density')``)::

            >>> from yt import load
            >>> from hyperion.grid import AMRGrid
            >>> ds = load('DD0010/moving7_0010')
            >>> amr = AMRGrid.from_yt(ds, quantity_mapping={'density':('gas', 'density')})

        However, you will need to take care if your dust opacities are defined
        in dust mass units. If the yt dataset does not contain dust densities,
        you can add a field yourself, for example::

            >>> from yt import load
            >>> from hyperion.grid import AMRGrid
            >>> ds = load('DD0010/moving7_0010')
            >>> def _dust_density(field, data):
            ...     return data[('gas', 'density')].in_units('g/cm**3') * 0.01
            >>> ds.add_field(('gas', 'dust_density'), function=_dust_density, units='g/cm**3', sampling_type='cell')

            >>> amr = AMRGrid.from_yt(ds, quantity_mapping={'density':('gas', 'dust_density')})
